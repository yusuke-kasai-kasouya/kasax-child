# kasax_child (kasax Child Theme)

> **Dynamic Intelligence Storage: Mapping Conceptual Hierarchies and Multi-perspective Thinking.**

## Overview

`kasax_child` is a custom child theme developed to transform WordPress from a simple blogging tool into a powerful **Creative Support Knowledge Base**.

This project is an "experimental implementation" designed to optimize thought organization and plot construction, as used daily by the author in a local environment (XAMPP).

**The system is fully optimized for use in a Japanese language environment, specifically designed to seamlessly handle complex hierarchical management using Japanese characters and double-byte symbols.**

**Note:** This theme is specifically designed for personal use and local development environments (XAMPP, etc.). Since the implementation of "original thinking logic" is prioritized over general security and broad compatibility, use on public servers is not recommended.

## Original Concept: Multi-Tree Intelligence Storage

This theme aims to multidimensionalize information through three core pillars:

**Multi-Tree Deployment of Knowledge**:
By using the logical path separator "≫" in titles, a single article can exist simultaneously in multiple contexts, allowing for the construction of complex thought hierarchies.

## Main Features & Shortcodes

While there are too many features to cover in their entirety, here are the core functions:

### 1. Hierarchical Navigator `[raretu]`

By writing `A≫B≫C` in the post title, the theme automatically analyzes the directory structure.

* Generates a list of child hierarchies when placed in a parent post.
* The UI (colors) changes dynamically based on specific prefixes.

### 2. Visual Categorization via Post Prefixes

Define the nature of information by adding specific characters to the beginning of post titles.

| Prefix | Category | Meaning / Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **κ** | Planning | Strategy / Milestones |
| **λ** | SYSTEM | System Specifications |
| **Μ** | Theory | Theoretical Background / Analysis |
| **Β/γ/σ/δ** | Shared Resources | Lessons / Sensitivity / Research / Documentation |
| **∫** | Production | Prototype / Experiment / Draft |
| **∬00** | Production | Final Production (Execution) |

### 3. Ghost Clone `[ghost id=xxx]`

Opens a "window" to a specific post. It creates a clone page that synchronizes and displays the content of the referenced post in real-time.

### 4. Advanced Link `[kx id=xxx t=60]`

Generates internal links by ID. By switching the `t` (type) parameter, you can flexibly change the density of information, such as "link only," "excerpt view," or "full content expansion."
